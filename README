This is modified version of tracepath, which can trace path to a
network host and display geographical position for each hop.

QQWry database is used for geographical position lookup (see
http://www.cz88.net/ for database download and
http://lumaqq.linuxsir.org/article/qqwry_format_detail.html for
detailed description). The database must be named as QQWry.Dat and
placed in the running directory of this tool.
